# SWE30011 IoT Project

This repository contains the project files for the IoT project developed for the course SWE30011. The project showcases the integration of various IoT technologies and includes both backend and frontend components.

## Project Overview

The IoT project aims to demonstrate the practical applications of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. It involves collecting, processing, and visualizing data from IoT devices.

## Project Structure

- **/html/**: HTML files for the web interface.
- **/python/**: Python scripts for data processing and device management.
- **/cpp/**: C++ code for IoT device firmware.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: 41.2%
- **Python**: 29.5%
- **C++**: 29.3%

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MinzLong/SWE30011-IOT-Project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd SWE30011-IOT-Project
   ```
3. **Set up the Python environment**:
   ```sh
   cd python
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Compile and upload the C++ code to your IoT device**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `/cpp` directory to compile and upload the firmware to your device.
5. **Run the Python scripts**:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Web Interface**: Open `index.html` in your web browser to interact with the IoT data.
- **Data Processing**: Use the Python scripts to collect and process data from the IoT devices.
